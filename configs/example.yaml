# Hyperparameters for training the model
training:
  num_epochs: 20            # number of epochs to train the model, which are the number of times the model sees the entire training dataset
  learning_rate: 0.00001   # learning rate for the optimiser, which is a technique to update the weights
  weight_decay: 0.001       # L2 regularization, which is a technique to reduce overfitting
  batch_size: 100            # batch size for training, which is the number of samples per gradient update
  patience: 7               # epochs before early stopping/learning rate decay
  early_stopping: True      # early stopping if validation loss does not improve
  use_scheduler: False       # learning rate decay if validation loss does not improve
  factor: 0.5               # factor by which the learning rate will be reduced, if use_scheduler is True
  initialise_weights: True  # initialise weights of the model
  balance_classes: True     # use class weights to balance the dataset
  criterion: 'BCELoss'      # loss function to use
  use_cosine_burnin: True          # use burnin for the learning rate scheduler
  #save_model: False

  #save_frequency: 1
  #save_plots: False

evaluation:
  use_saved_model: False

  # add check-points (use pickle files and save model after each epoch) etc.
